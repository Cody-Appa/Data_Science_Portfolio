I then classified the bosses by whether they were AOE, Single target, or a mix. This projects goal is to analyze all of the classes in the game by the top 10 of every fight and determine which specs are good at what in the game.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.4.0      ✔ purrr   1.0.1 \n✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.2.1      ✔ stringr 1.5.0 \n✔ readr   2.1.3      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readxl)\n\nDPSsheet<-read.csv(\"DataVizMidterm - Sheet1.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(scales)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'scales'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    discard\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following object is masked from 'package:readr':\n\n    col_factor\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(DPSsheet, aes(x=Class, y=DPS)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Top DPS by class\", caption = \"Overall dps for the top 10 of every boss in the raid\") +\n  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = .5)) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scientific_format())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](MidtermPortfolio_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n## Point plot\nA point plot shows the general gist of what's going on if I just graph them overall.

You can clearly see hunters in the lead in both single target and aoe which is why they are a large outlier. As well as mages being good at single target and mixed fights. Druid may be an outlier in AOE situations but have zero single target which is why they aren't as imbalanced.",
