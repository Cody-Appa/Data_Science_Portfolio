I then classified the bosses by whether they were area of effect (AOE), Single target, or a mix of both. This projects goal is to analyze all of the classes in the game by the top 10 of every fight and determine which classes do the most damage on which fights/fight styles in the game.\n\n## Data\n\nData was acquired from the Warcraftlogs website https://www.warcraftlogs.com/ using the boss rankings for each boss fight. Warcraftlogs is used by all top guilds and most casual players to compare their DPS rankings to eachother and break down individual performances. I took this data from the top 10 rankings (parses) for each boss in the patch of 10.0.2 so data may be dated.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(scales))\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(scales)\nDPSsheet<-read.csv(\"DataVizMidterm - Sheet1.csv\")\nMidtermDictionary<-read_excel(\"MidtermSheet.xlsx\")\nknitr::kable(MidtermDictionary)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Attribute  |Type         |Description                                                             |\n|:----------|:------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|Class      |Categorical  |The class being utilized by the player.                                 |\n|DPS        |Quantitative |The damager per second done by the player by the end of the boss fight. |\n|Boss       |Categorical  |The boss encounter that was defeated to generate the data.              |\n|Rank       |Ordinal      |Ranking 1-10 for the top 10 players by DPS.                             |\n|Fight.Type |Categorical  |Area of effect (AOE), Single target, or a mix of both.                  |\n|Appearance |Ordinal      |Each player who reaches top 10 gets a 1 to normalize ranking.           |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Top 10 ranking by Fight Type\n\nThis graph visualizes the number of times each class appears in the top 10 for every encounter type in the raid.
