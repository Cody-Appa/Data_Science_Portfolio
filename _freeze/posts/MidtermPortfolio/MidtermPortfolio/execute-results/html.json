I then classified the bosses by whether they were AOE, Single target, or a mix. This projects goal is to analyze all of the classes in the game by the top 10 of every fight and determine which specs are good at what in the game.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(scales))\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(scales)\nDPSsheet<-read.csv(\"DataVizMidterm - Sheet1.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Top 10 ranking by Fight Type\nThis graph visualizes the number of times each class appears in the top 10 for every encounter type in the raid.
